# roguehike

A simple roguelike not-quite game in Clojure. Go climb a virtual mountain here!

Use numpad or vi keys (hjklyubn) for moving. Press q to exit.

Unlike most roguelikes, roguehike uses side-view camera angle. There is no saving, winning, or losing, but the mountains are always worth climbing.
